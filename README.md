## UdaciCards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

UdaciCards was created for [Udacity's](https://udacity.com) React nanodegree program, and is a mobile app that
allows the users to create decks of flash cards for a quick method to study.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply

```
cd into the project folder

yarn start
```

This project uses yarn as opposed to NPM, because at the time of this writing, there was issues with using React Native and NPM.

To view the application, open the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone (or scan the QR code provided by the terminal),
or if you are using a simulator, you will be given the option to launch the application in either ios or android simulators.

The project was developed and tested on IOS.
